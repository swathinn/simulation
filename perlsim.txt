sim-fast: This simulator implements a very fast functional simulator.  This
functional simulator implementation is much more difficult to digest than
the simpler, cleaner sim-safe functional simulator.  By default, this
simulator performs no instruction error checking, as a result, any
instruction errors will manifest as simulator execution errors, possibly
causing sim-fast to execute incorrectly or dump core.  Such is the
price we pay for speed!!!!
